\cite{fully convolutional networs for semantic seg}
Neural networks operate at pixel level by sumultanesously learning which features to extract and how to classify them.
those designed for semantic segmentation consist of hierarchical layers that encode both local and global information in a non-linear manner. these layers of neurons compute convolutions on the previous layer outputs. The layers are stacked and combined with max-pooling and elementwise non-linear transfer functions to extract higher order features from input. The output is a probability vector on which as softmax is applied to predict the output label.
Skip architecture takes advantage of this structure
CNNS rely on textural information: analyze texture patterns at different spatial scales through convolution layers. Theye learn to stract features such as edges,corners, gradients that are characteristics of different objects/classes. 


Typical recognition networks like AlexNet,Lennet take fixed sized inputs and produce non-spatial outputs

Fully convolutional netwoks combines alyers of the feature hierachy and refine the spatial precision of the output.
Fine tuned fully convolutionalized layers classifiers produce coarse output hence skips tp combine final prediction with lower layers with finer strides.
Skip connections accelerate training
